Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 
This is Mostafiz Rahman, a young entrepreneur from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently I'm working in [Durbin Labs Limited](http://durbinlabs.com) as Engineering Director. 

I'm a Full Stack engineer. **Full Stack** in a sense that I work in the API and Back-ends, I work on the client end in both web and mobile clients. For Back-end I love NodeJs, for web client end I work with React and for Mobile I use React Native to build cross platform mobile applications.
